DS Universe – Skyport Inventory Adventure

Zrar the Explorer enters the Golden Login Gateway, ready to oversee the Skyport’s floating cargo platforms.

A (Linked List), the Sky Bridge Engineer, connects each platform in perfect order — allowing new shipments to attach smoothly and old platforms to detach without breaking the chain.

B (Stack), the Tower of Rewinds, records every operation; mistakes disappear instantly as B pops the most recent action.

C (Array) manages the Cloud Ledger, displaying stock counts, low-stock alerts, and reports in a neatly organized panel.

D (Assistant) navigates the Skyport, adding new products, updating items, and consulting analytics from C to keep everything stable.

Every cargo, action, and report flows efficiently thanks to the synergy of A (Linked List), B (Stack), and C (Array).

The Skyport Inventory System ensures operations are reversible, accurate, and always visible in real-time.

With Zrar leading the way, the DS Skyport becomes a living, dynamic system — a perfect demonstration of Linked List, Stack, and Array working together in harmony.
